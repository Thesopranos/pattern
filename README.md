# pattern
A ball going in one direction bounces off the walls to create a pattern with opencv

If you want to change the direction of the ball, you can swap n and m because x and y will change with the increment of n and m.

If you make n and m the same, it will constantly go back and forth between the two vertices because the increments are the same.
